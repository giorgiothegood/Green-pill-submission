# Green pill avatar for Gitcoin bounty

It's a pleasure to work in this commit, doing art. 

My task here is to create an avatar concept for the avatar builder. The steps include to design an avatar from a requested list, post sketch, keep contact with the project's staff people and move forward to evolute the idea. They asked for a "green pill" themed avatar with a influence of 4 diferent kinds of content, in addition of another 2 images done by someone.
My art must be 350x350 px in viewport, original (it will ever be) and must comply on SVG specs: organized and named in DOM format, where objects of the style is separated by groups.

## Starting

I always dedicate a time to read the briefing with attention. Then, I dedicate another to discover ideas and brainstorms. Through that way, I am already thinking in design. So, this is a handmade <-> digital work created by me, using Adobe Photoshop and Adobe Illustrator to do ideation and final art, while sketching by my hands.

## Users

The satisfaction of users and costumers is really important, as we have a funcional product. In this case, it's art, and my proprosal is to do it with feeling and by a organic way. The avatar's users are personas-like good people, funny, with a young spirit. They can be a 1950-1990's nerd or geek, it doesn't matter at all. The scope here is to make people happy!

## Sketch and DOM

Even though I sketched some diferent assets to include as DOM, as the project progresses I has to change my planning. We can see the inicial sketch...

Then, through the next steps, I decided to work with famous coins on the background of the final art.

## Final art

As I wrote, I've worked with 3 famous coins: BTC, ETH and BNB. The background follows colors that are on the composition of the branding of each coin. Follow the work...
